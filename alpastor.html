<h2> To serve...</h2>

<h3> Directions</h3>

<ol type = "1">
    <li>Place chiles in a large saucepan over medium high heat and cook, turning chiles occasionally, until puffed, pliable, lightly browned in spots,
        and very aromatic, about 5 minutes. Add chicken stock (it should boil immediately), then pour contents of pan into a small bowl. Cover loosely and set aside.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>Wipe out saucepan, add oil, and return to medium-high heat until oil is shimmering. Add cumin, oregano, and achiote and cook, stirring frequently, until aromatic but not brown, about 30 seconds. Add chiipotle chile and sauce and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds longer. Add vinegar, salt and sugar and remove from heat.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>Scrape contents of saucepan into a blender along with garlic and chiles with their soaking liquid. Blend on high speed until completely smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down sides as necessary. Set sauce aside to cool slightly.</li>

    <br>

    <li>Using a very shap chef's knife or slicing knife, slice pork sirloin as thin as possible. If necessary, place meat in freezer for 15 minutes to firm it up.
        Split the sides of a heavy duty zipper-lock bag. Place one slice of meat inside bag and poind with the bottom of a heavy 8-inch skillet or meat pounded until less that 1/4 thick. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with remaining meat.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>Add marinade to bowl and toss with hands until every piece of meat is evenly coated in marinade.</li>
    
    <br>

    <li> Line the bottom of a disposable aluminum loaf pan with a layer of bacon. Add a layer of thin-sliced marinated meat. Continue layering in bacon and meat until all the meat is used. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 36.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li> Cooking indoors, preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Uncover the alumium loaf pan and place on a foil lined rimmed baking sheet. Transfer to oven and cook until meat is completely tender. (It will drip lots of fat), about  4 hours. Remove from oven, allow to cool slightly, cover with aluminum foil, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.

    </li>

    <br>

    <li> <b>To Serve:</b> Preheat oven to 350F. Remove cooked meat from aluminum tray, scraping off any fat or jellied juices from its sides. Use a spoon to collect fat and juices from tray, reserving each seperately. Using a sharp chef's knife or slicing knife, slice meat as thinly as possible to create fine shavings of meat and fat. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
